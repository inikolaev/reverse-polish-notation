An example of reverse Polish notation implementation

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands unlike a traditional infix notation in which operators are placed betweentheir operands.

An example of infix notation: 

```
2 + 3
```

The same expression written using RPN:

```
2 3 +
```
